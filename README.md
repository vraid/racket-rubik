# Rubik
What if we could view each side of a Rubik's cube at once?

[MÃ¶bius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation) make it possible!

Inspired by the beatufiul visualization shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z1fIsUNhO4), by reshaping the cube into a sphere we can project it onto a plane.

This project is a fully functional implementation of a Rubik's cube, supporting all the complex motions such as twisting and turning.

With this new perspective, we will all finally be able to solve a Rubik's cube. Surely?

It can be run with [DrRacket](https://download.racket-lang.org/) (though it may need administrative privileges on windows).
